=== Version 0.8.0, June 20, 2011 ===

This release involved big refactorings. The addition of branches, particularly, changes the DB schema, so that old DBs will need to be migrated. See instructions of how to migrate in the Wiki pages.

Major features:
* acdha added support for git and github
* Danilo implemented branches. A revision is now always associated to a branch, and different branches can be compared in the Comparison view
* Server Logging
* David Fraser added new documetation explaining the Codespeed views and concepts


=== Version 0.7.0, Jan 20, 2011 ===

Major features:
* New home page with result Reports: show summary of latest benchmark runs
* RSS feed showing Reports
* Support for Netbooks, tablets, and smartphones screen sizes through the use of media query
* Big performance improvements in the Changes and Timeline views
* Added settings for change and trend thresholds and default comparison executables
* Mercurial support


=== Version 0.6.2, Jul 25, 2010 ===

Bug Fix release

* Changes view:
    - Render a different results table for each unit type.
      Finally fixes color coding of benchmark results which have different "lessisbetter" values
    - Display min/max columns if data present
    - Display only significant digits (automatically calculated precision)
    - Small CSS touches


=== Version 0.6.1, Jul 16, 2010 ===

Bug fix release

* General:
    - Repare 404 and 500 pages
* Changes view:
    - Fix units column and less is better checking in the changes table
    - Stop loading commit logs when URL does not respond
    Timeline view:
    - Fix timeline grid bug triggered when benchmarks names present with special characters (reported by joe)
    - Don't display grid option when only one benchmark present
* Comparison view:
    - Fix several small bugs
    - Make chart defaults configurable in settings (whished by joe)
    - Change in style when there are lots of benchmarks: no bar padding.
    - Fix benchmark/legend ordering
    - Improve error messages
    - Issue correctness warning for normalized stacked bars.
    
* Known bugs:
    - There are several bugs in the comparison view related to the plotting library jqplot
    - Bad autoscaling under some circumstancies. Issue#199 (http://bitbucket.org/cleonello/jqplot/issue/199/autoscale-breaks-negative-values)
    - infinite loop in some cases, notably when there are no result values for some benchmarks. Issue#200 (http://bitbucket.org/cleonello/jqplot/issue/200/autoscale-error)


=== Version 0.6.0, Jun 23, 2010 ===

This release brings a new view, together with many other changes. Unfortunately the DB Schema had to be changed, so it is not compatible with existing databases without migration. The decision was taken in order to make the executable model simpler.

    * DB Modifications:
        o Executable: removed coptions and added a description field, as it really didn't bring much and it made things unecessarily complicated. This is the main reason for a DB change
        o Benchmark: Added a units_title field, which is used as plot title
        o Charfield lengths where adjusted
    * New feature: Comparison view
        o Normal bar charts
        o Cumulative bar charts
        o Relative bar charts
        o Horizontal or verical orientation
    * Name change: Overview became Changes
        o Removal of inline plot bars (covered now by the comparison view)
        o Added environment and executable info box
    * Timeline view:
        o Allow to select a baseline
        o Added plot title


=== Version 0.5, May 10, 2010 ===

The focus of this release was polishing, making everything work seamlessly and cementing the DB design. The DB Schema should remain stable from now on. Last but not least, the installation and configuration process of codespeed was greatly simplified and is now documented.

I believe codespeed is now ready for general use.
Thanks go to Joe and to Oriol Rius for their feedback, which made this posible.

          o Result model now has std deviation, max, and min optional fields. Result_type removed (in Benchmark model now).
